# FMODEL
This is a set of NetLogo simulations of the formation of stone artefact scatters and patterning in lithic cortex, associated with a forthcoming publication:

Davies, B., S. J. Holdaway, and P. C. Fanning. *In press*. Modeling relationships between space, movement, and lithic geometric attributes. Accepted to *American Antiquity*.
